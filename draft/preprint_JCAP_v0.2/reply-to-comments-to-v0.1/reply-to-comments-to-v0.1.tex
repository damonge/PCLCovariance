\maketitle
We have carefully addressed the referee's questions and concerns. The
modifications we have performed, for each of the numbered requests, are as
follow:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Abstract. Line 9. Added explicit reference to CMB. We have changed
    \textit{expanding on existing algorithms} to \textit{expanding on existing algorithms \cgg{for CMB}}.
  \item  Page 8. After Eq. 2.44. Added GPE2 reference.
  \item  \dots
  \item  Last sentence of 3.3. Added \textit{or computed exactly as in [41,
      44]}. In the second to last paragraph of Section 4, we added at the end
    \textit{or exactly following Refs.~[41, 44]}.
  \item  In Section 3.3, before previous sentence, we changed \textit{If accurate
    covariances bars} to \textit{If accurate covariance matrix \cgg{elements}}.
\item  In Section 3.4, before Eq. 3.8, I have mentioned the Gaussian
  approximation of the likelihood: \textit{Assuming flat priors \cgg{and a
      fiducial Gaussian likelihood approximation [21]}}.
  \item  Second paragraph of Section 3.4. Changed \textit{for of two
      parameters} to \textit{for the \cgg{two} parameters}.
\end{enumerate}

Changes related to the CMB background:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  
\end{enumerate}

Extra changes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Changed $\Delta x^2$ to $\Delta^2 x$.
  \item  Introduction. Line 3. Updated the set of references for CMB.
  \item  Added HEALPix project url and credits in the Acknowledgments.
\end{enumerate}
